### Step 4:

Create a new wallet using the instructions provided. Don't forget to backup your seed phrase safely. The seed phrase gives you access to your specific wallet address (private key/seed phrase), without it, you cannot access that address again.

Confirm you know your seed phrase by following the instructions.

### Step 6:

Give your wallet a password. This password will be used every time you want to log into this specific wallet (so you don't have to copy and paste your seed phrase in every time). Don't confuse this with your seedphrase. This password = used to protect this wallet. Seedphrase = key to access your blockchain address.

### Step 6 (optional):

Import your current KMD address, instead of creating a new one. 

Click import "Import Wallet" & enter the seed phrase of the address you'd like to import.
